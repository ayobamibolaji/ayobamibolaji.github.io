				 <b><u>Introduction</u></b>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 Most people call me Ayo. My full name, Ayobami, can mean "My Joy ("Ayo") has come ("bami"). I identify with the Yoruba Nigerian ethnic group/tribe. In computer science, I am interested in AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Computer Networks. Currently, I hope to obtain a part-time or full-time position as a software-developer after graduating from college. I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, and currently I plan to live in Atlanta throughout most of my professional career. In my spare time, I like to play soccer, play guitar, workout, and spend time with family and friends.

				 <br>
				 <b><u>Cultural Background</u></b>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 Growing up as a Nigerian raised in the United States has given me the opportunity to experience different cultures from a young age. I was immersed in Yoruba music, the language, and clothing. At the same time, I experienced American food, and were able to draw contrasts and discover similarities between the two. One similarity that I personally observed, is that both Nigerian and American culture, seem to emphasize feelings of pride. Personally, I now try not to be prideful, but in my experiences I was always taught to be proud of where I come from and the values that I uphold. Another similarity is determination. In my journey, I have seen that both cultures seem to push children to succeed and achieve what their parents could not. From a young age, I was taught to be the best in everything that I do, and to keep my eyes focused on my goals. Now, I try not to allow personal endeavors to consume me, because among them I have other priorities. One of the differences that I perceived is that Nigerian culture seems to emphasize a greater sense of a men-oriented society. By this I mean that the Father is usually the head of the household. In American culture, I believe that this was the case in earlier times, but in recent years it seems that this is not the case. I have
				 heard and encountered several families in which headship is given to the Mother, or even split between the Father and Mother. Of course, these are only my personal and limited observations, so I could definitely be incorrect about these claims.
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <b><u>Goals</u></b>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 My current goals in life revolve around my spirituality and how I can best maintain it. As one of <a href="https://jw.org" target="_blank" >Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, I am especially concerned with how I can grow and maintain my spirituality, and this takes priority in my life. Being one of Jehovah's Witnesses has shaped how I view everything around me, and currently it has been the biggest influence in my life. Therefore, one of my current aspirations is to obtain a part-time software development job, so that I can support myself a full-time minister.

				 <b><u>Hobbies and Other Interests</u></b>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 Among my hobbies and other interests, no two stand out more than playing guitar and playing soccer. I have been playing guitar for a little over two years now. Granted, I have not grown much (in my opinion), however it has been a great source of comfort, fun, and relaxation. Often, I play guitar as a way to de-stress and detach myself from what's going on around me. I usually play songs in the soft rock and alternative rock genres. For example, one the first songs that I learned was "Yellow" from the band called Coldplay. To this day, I know many Coldplay songs, as well as songs from OneRepublic, The Script, Death Cab for Cutie, and The Fray. At first, I started to play guitar as a way to impress my prom date, but through that process I quickly grew attached to playing guitar. Currently, I play a few times a week for about an hour. Sometimes I'll play my favorite songs or try to learn a new one. I am also very interested in learning fingerstyle guitar, as well as incorporating more percussion sounds into my playing. I also plan on creating some YouTube videos in which I cover songs, and I plan on updating this site once I do so. Currently, I want to become a guitar player that can comfortably sing and play at the same time. While I am able to do this decently with a handful of songs, sometime in the future I would like to develop my singing skills. I also would like to be able to play a few songs in fingerstyle fashion.
				<br>
				<br>
				 If I am able to "master" the guitar, then I think I will go on to play Piano or the Ukulele. These are two instruments that I would love to be able to play. In particular, a lot of the songs I sing in connection with my religious background are played on Piano, and it would be cool to be able to play these songs to my fellow believers.
				 <br>
				 <br>
				I have played soccer for a very long time. From when I was middle school to now, I also enjoy being to "kick around" with others. In high school I played on my school's team for two years and kind of distinguished myself as a leader. I was made captain on several occasions, and I tended to  express myself by calmly shouting commands at my teammates. In high school I also practiced a sport called Football Freestyle. It's a young sport related to soccer that revolves around using different body parts to perform tricks with a soccer ball. This is a <a href=https://youtube.com/watch?v=Cp6ylH80wOQ target="_blank" >great example</a> of how that is done at a professional level. I practiced the sport for about a year, and it was a great experience. It is a great way to do cardio exercise while having fun, and it taught me how to properly strectch before exercising. Of course, playing a soccer team also taught me how to stretch and warm-up, but this process was more detailed in Football Freestyle (FF). In FF, there are so many delicate movements that can easily lead to strains and other injuries, so I really had to develop my warm-up routine, to adequatley stretch all of the muscle groups involved. My warm-up routine generally lasted fifteen to twenty minutes, and included a variety of stretching exercises for my legs and arms. When I started college, my interest in the sport died down due to other priorities, but every now and then I'll pick up my soccer ball and do some tricks. There are still a few tricks that I have maintained, such as balancing the ball on my forehead and being able to juggle the ball.
